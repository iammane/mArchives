Little projects, notes - anything related to security centric topics (where the other items are more sysadmin/dev type).

1. [Windows Sec Tool Setup](https://github.com/iammane/mArchives/blob/main/Security%20Items/Windows%20Sec%20Tool%20Setup.md) - Guide to setting up a run of the mill Windows PC with additional tooling that can be helpful for various security investigations. This is for if you are using Windows and don't necessarily want to run a full virtualization thick client and whole VM. This setup is based on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

**NOTE** - this may be a little out of date, and in all fairness I've actually switched over to VirtualBox with a full Kali OS install.
