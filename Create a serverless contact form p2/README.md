# Create a serverless contact form (a case study in not re-inventing the wheel) - Part 2

## Introduction

This is the second part to my first 'Create a serverless contact form' roblog entry. This is LONG overdue, things have gotten busy with work and such, but I promise this is short and sweet.

## How-To

Follow all directions here: [Web3 Forms](https://web3forms.com/)

...no seriously. You could go through all the pain of setting up your own infrastructure for a serverless contact form, or, simply build out a form and inject this platform into it. It's a no brainer. Even if you wanted to pay the 8 bucks a month for it (at the time of this writing) it would be worth it because the service just works, and really well. Not to mention, nothing to update.

Sometimes it's just not worth re-inventing the wheel.

## Recap

Visit here [Web3 Forms](https://web3forms.com/), follow the very simple directions and tailor accordingly.

## Important notes and limitations

The free version of this does have some limitations, mainly in how many submissions are allowed per month. That said though this is the simplest way of rolling a contact form I could find. It's also pretty customizable if you're happy to get your hands dirty a bit. The [pricing](https://web3forms.com/pricing) page explains all the caveats, but for a small to even medium sized business it might just do the trick - the barrier to entry is very, very low.

Thanks for reading!

### Addendum note

February 17th, 2025 - It's important to note that with the free version of Web3 Forms at least it doesn't appear you can revoke the key. So I'm in the process of dismantling all things _complex robot_ and now until.. forever.. or until Web3 Forms cleans up, or goes out of business or something, people can use my public access key to send emails from ANYTHING to complexrobotworks[at]gmail.com. Thankfully, I won't be checking it once this is all done... but still. So much for a nice cleanup. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
