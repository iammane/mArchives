## Welcome to the mArchives!

This is a collection of various guides I've put together to accomplish different things. None of this information is unique, per se. It's very readily available anywhere on the 'net (or just ask ChatGPT ðŸ˜œ) - but I'm using this as a way to catalog my experiences in implementing different pieces of infrastructure or code to complete specific tasks. These items are spread across ops, security, anything I think is interesting or worth diving into a bit for practice or just to understand better.

Each article will be split out into its own folder with related artifacts so that you can follow along. 

Enjoy!

Upcoming topics:

1. Would REALLY like to sink my teeth into open source SAST/SCA and container scanning (selfishly, need this for work too). Intending on documenting what's found out here!
